## Societal Impact of Portable Computing


The new age of technology has been a major benefit to society and intrapersonal relationships. 
Having contiuous access to mobile phones and social media has allowed people to communicate with one another far more frequently than what it was in the past.
Applications such as social media, along with various messaging apps creates a widespread ability to text, rather than calling people. The disadvantage of this, however, is that today's youth are far more incapable of interacting with each other, whether its talking on the phone or connecting in person.
This has created a heavy reliance amongst people on AI softwares such as Replika AI in order to fill the emotional void they have from lack of human interaction. 
News outlets such as RTE state that nearly 1 in every 10,000 have had some sort of relationship with AI, both physical and romantic, in the last year. 
This lonliness epidemic is stressed by the fact that we have such easy access to phones and the internet, where the options online are limitless, making it extremely difficult to ignore. 
The easy access to portable computing creates an easy method of gaining and developing knowledge and skills. 
This access is readily available in many countries globablly, which allows individuals to form their own opinions regarding topics such as politics. On the other hand, this creates an easy way to spread misinformation and propaganda, creating hostile environments. 
For example, the democratic state of the United States of America since 2020 has been under extreme stress due to minsinformation being spread amongst the media, leading to an heavy mistrust in both the government and the voting system. 
Studies such as the Collaborative Multi-Racial Political Study highlighted that around 57% of white Americans believed in some kind of voter fraud in the 2020 elections. 
This highlights the strong impact misinformation has on society.

Portable Computing has completely transformed the current workplace. Access to the internet has allowed the integration of hybrid and remote work. Remote work is defined as a modern form of working from outside the workplace, often ensuring increased flexibility of a person's time. This has been proven to be important for a worker's wellbeing, giving time to hobbies and interpersonal relationships outside of the office. However, it's been recorded amongst younger generations that workers are wanting less-remote work, stating they tend to feel more loneyly during the working day. 24% of Generation Z surveyed by IRP stated that they wanted less-remote work, while 33% of Millenials opted for more remote work. This highlights a want in the more technology literate generations for more in-person human connection, despite having the option of being able to work from their own homes.

## First links to research 

[*A computer in your pocket: The rise of smartphones | Science Museum​ **](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/)

## Research from link  

### Quick facts 

- Almost all smartphones now have microprocessors which allow for increased computing power in a small place. 

- ARM “Advanced Risc Machines” efficiently give instructions to the circuits on the microprocessors, providing lots of computing power for relatively little energy 

- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) allows for very fast data processing by reducing the number of instructions a computer can perform to the minimum 

- 3G(third generation) mobile networks introduced in the UK from 2003 4G from 2012 

## Mobiles before smartphones 

 - Mobiles before smartphones where a lot simpler. Instead of having a lot of apps to message people on there was one and instead of face time or WhatsApp video call you could only make a general phone call 

 

-Mobiles didn't have access to the internet so people couldn't google things. Because all mobile phones weren't connected to the internet this meant that messaging and calling people wasn’t free 

 

## What is the technology behind smartphones? 

- There were two major factors that led to the production of the first smartphone.  


- The first was the development of the ARM microprocessor The ARM microprocessor was originally designed in the early 1980’s by Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson at the British company Acorn Computers. At the time ARM - stood for Acorn RISC Machines but they are now called advanced Risc Machines. 

- These chips are important because they can give information to the circuits very efficiently producing a lot of computing power while only taking up a small amount of energy 

- The addition of these chips to mobile phones allowed them to execute tasks much faster than they normally could. 

- The second thing that helped in the production of the first smartphones was the release of 3G Networks. 

- 3G Networks made it possible for users to send and receive videos due to the increased data transmition rates.  Today these networks have developed even further, with the arrival of 4g in 2012 and the current development of 5G 

- Britian held an auction in 2000 to sell the license to operate 3G networks in the UK. 6 companies paid a total of 22.5 billion which was 4 times the government’s estimate but these companies benefited greatly from having a license to operate 3G networks. 

 

## Smart phones take off: 

- In 2008 apple launches iphone 3G. It was open to anyone with skills to add to their own creations to an enticing range od apps, ranging from anything from mobile games to messaging apps, competitors quickly started releasing their own smartphones and by the end of 2013, 1 in 5 people owned a smartphone world wide.

[**1 iPhone Accessibility Features That Make Life Easier for Everyone - TechPP**](https://techpp.com/2025/07/31/iphone-accessibility-features/)

 

- Accessibility in technology means making sure that everyone can use phones, computers, and other devices, no matter their disability. It is about giving equal access and making life easier for people who might find technology difficult to use. In this section, I will talk about what accessibility means, how it has developed over time, what features exist today, and what problems still make it hard for some people to use modern technology. I will also give my own thoughts about what I believe works well and what could still be better.

- Years ago, technology was not made for people with disabilities. Before smartphones be-came popular, most blind people used phones with buttons and had to remember exactly what to press for each action. Writing a message or checking the time took many steps, and most of the time, help from others was needed. I think that made people like me feel de-pendent on others instead of independent. Things started to change when companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google began to design their systems with accessibility built in. Ap-ple, for example, made accessibility one of its main values, which I believe was one of the best decisions the company ever made. It showed that accessibility should not be an extra feature—it should be part of every product.

- One of the biggest breakthroughs was the creation of screen readers. A screen reader is a program that reads out what is on the screen or sends it to a braille display so that blind users can understand it. On the iPhone, this feature is called VoiceOver. On Android, it is called TalkBack, and on computers, there are programs like NVDA or Narrator. When I use VoiceOver, I can slide my finger across the screen, and the phone tells me what I am touch-ing. I can double tap to open something or swipe to move to another item. It is not an exag-geration to say that VoiceOver changed how blind people live. Before it, I had to rely on help, but now I can do everything myself, from reading messages to using maps or shopping online.

- Another important improvement is braille support. Many blind users connect small devices called braille displays to their phones or computers. These devices use small moving pins that form braille letters so that you can read by touch. I often use a braille display when I want to read quietly without voice. It is great for studying or working because it gives full control and privacy. Apple supports many different types of braille displays, which makes it easier for people to find one that suits their needs.

- For people with low vision, accessibility includes things like the Magnifier, which uses the camera to zoom in on objects or text, and display options such as bold text, larger fonts, and high-contrast colours. People who are deaf or hard of hearing can use features like live cap-tions or have the phone send vibrations when it detects certain sounds like alarms or crying. For people with limited movement, there is Voice Control. It lets users speak to the phone to open apps, scroll, write messages, or take photos without touching the screen. I think these tools show that accessibility is not only about helping blind users; it helps many people in different ways.

- Apple also introduced something called the back tap feature. This allows users to double tap or triple tap the back of the iPhone to perform a specific action. For example, I can set a double tap to turn VoiceOver on or off, which saves me time when I need to use it quickly. The triple tap can be set to do anything I want, such as taking a screenshot, opening an app, locking the phone, or even turning on the flashlight. I think this feature is very clever be-cause it makes accessibility easier to reach for everyone. It is one of those small details that show how thoughtful design can make a big difference.

- Even with all of these improvements, I still believe there are problems that need attention. Many app developers do not follow accessibility rules when designing their apps. I have opened apps where all the buttons are simply read as “button” or “image,” giving no idea of what they actually do. This makes the app impossible to use. I think that is one of the biggest frustrations for screen reader users. The tools exist, but people don’t always use them cor-rectly.

- Another big issue is cost. Accessibility features themselves are free, but the devices that support them well are expensive. Not everyone can afford an iPhone or a modern braille dis-play. Some of the best braille devices cost thousands of euros, and that leaves out many peo-ple who could really benefit from them. I think accessibility should not depend on how much money you have. Everyone deserves access to the same technology.

- Software updates can also cause problems. Each time a new version of iOS comes out, I feel nervous because sometimes it breaks features that used to work perfectly. There were times when VoiceOver stopped speaking or changed how gestures worked, which made it harder to use the phone. Accessibility should always be stable, and updates should be tested carefully before they are released.

- Privacy is another concern. Some accessibility tools, especially voice-based features, collect information to improve accuracy. This is useful, but I think it is important to make sure that user data is safe. Accessibility should not come with the risk of losing privacy.

- Lastly, I think there needs to be more awareness about accessibility. Many people still be-lieve it only matters to a small group, but in truth, it helps everyone. Large text, clear lay-outs, or voice control can make technology easier to use for older people, children, or any-one who wants simpler navigation. I believe schools and workplaces should teach more about accessibility so that it becomes a normal part of how technology is created, not some-thing added later.

- To sum up, accessibility in technology is about fairness and inclusion. It allows people like me to live independently, study, and communicate freely. Tools such as screen readers, braille displays, magnifiers, voice control, and back tap features show how far technology has come. However, there are still issues like high costs, poor app design, unstable updates, and lack of awareness. I think if developers, companies, and governments worked together more seriously, accessibility could be a natural part of every device. In the end, it is not about giving special treatment to people with disabilities. It is about giving everyone the same chance to be part of the digital world.

History of portable computing – 1982 to 1986 – Cots


Societal Viewpoint – Nina Stowe

Phones have changed how we live and communicate; they are not just tools they are a part of everyday life.

- people in rural areas can now access information, banking and education using their phones
- phones can also help in emergencies and can connect to family or helpline services instantly
- health apps where doctors can monitor patients remotely
- social life as well we can connect to people by messages, call or post anytime, anywhere

However, this creates new problems, like people becoming too dependant on their phones, there’s privacy issues, and inequality where not everyone can afford the latest technology. 

The concept of “Portable private- personal territory” when someone uses a phone in a public space they create a bubble around them that travels with them. the device mediates their engagement with their psychical enviroment.

Public behaviors are shiftting examples,
- people can talk, browse, send messages while in a public space but they are also more isolated and detached from their immediate psychial surroundings

" Unlike computer users, cell phone owners are mobile, immersed in the crowd, yet able to communicate beyond it"
