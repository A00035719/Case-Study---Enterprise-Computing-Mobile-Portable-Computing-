Societal Viewpoint – Nina Stowe

Phones have changed how we live and communicate; they are not just tools they are a part of everyday life.

- people in rural areas can now access information, banking and education using their phones
- phones can also help in emergencies and can connect to family or helpline services instantly
- health apps where doctors can monitor patients remotely
- social life as well we can connect to people by messages, call or post anytime, anywhere

However, this creates new problems, like people becoming too dependant on their phones, there’s privacy issues, and inequality where not everyone can afford the latest technology. 

The concept of “Portable private- personal territory” when someone uses a phone in a public space they create a bubble around them that travels with them. the device mediates their engagement with their psychical enviroment.

Public behaviors are shiftting examples,
- people can talk, browse, send messages while in a public space but they are also more isolated and detached from their immediate psychial surroundings

" Unlike computer users, cell phone owners are mobile, immersed in the crowd, yet able to communicate beyond it"
