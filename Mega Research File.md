Engineering viewpoint

The effects of mobile and portable computing are very influential in how engineers design modern digital devices. Smartphones, tablets, and lightweight laptops have to be enquipped with powerful processors, high resolution screens,advanced sensors, and multiple wireless comunication systems while still remaining small, portable, and energy efficient. Researchers in mobile systems, such as Satyanaranan's highly influential paper "Fundamental Challenges in Mobile Computing" (Google Scolar, 1996), can show that to ensure efficent work, engineers must design hardware operating within tight constraints, limited battery capacity, erratic wireless signals, and users in perpetual motion. these constraints drove engineers to respond with innovation, including system on chip designs where the CPU, GPU, memory controller, and wireless modules are integrated into a single compact chip to save power, reduce heat, and raise overall performance.

The most important Engineering challenges are, of course, battery life. in particular, modern devices have to run power hungry apps, bright screens, and many sensors in the background for extensive amounts of time. several servey papers exist on energy efficentmobile and wireless systems, such as jones et al. (2001) and khan et al. (2015)which describes how engineers use techniques like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, low power ARM architectures, and advanced battery controllers to reduce energy consumption. Another approch lies in designing power saving modes for radios and sensors, Wireless communication remains one of the largest drains on mobile batteries.

portable computing has also had a major impact on mechanical and materials engineering. Jstor research such as Bell's "Unseen Connections: The Materiality of Cell Phones"nd Jacobs' "The Magic Inside Your Cell Phone" features some of the complex materials that make up smartphones, including reinforced glass, rare-earth metals, compact cameras, antenna arrays, and heat management structures. Devices must be designed to remain thin and lightweight but also survive drops and vibration, surviving daily use, since mobile devices can't rely on internal cooling fans like larger computers, they have to depend on passive cooling techniques such as graphite heat spreading sheets, vapour chambers, and internal metal frames to prevent overheating.

Another domain in which portable computing strongly influences engineering is the area of wireless engineering. Devices must support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and 4G/5G radios within an extremely small space. Antennas must be painstakingly placed to avoid interference and maintain strong signal performance. Research by Harari et al. (2016, Google Scholar) shows that mobile devices integrate many sensors GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and microphones while keeping accuracy high and power consumption low. This forces engineers to design compact, efficient sensors and internal layouts so that all the different parts can work together without quickly depleting the battery.

In all, the engineering behind mobile and portable computing illustrates just how much innovation is involved in making today's normal devices perform as users would expect. Engineers have to constantly balance high performance against extended battery life, make durable materials that are lightweight, and handle heat without the use of fans all while continuing to keep wireless connections stable. These ongoing engineering challenges shape the future of mobile and portable technology year after year.

The evolution of batteries for phones and storage has been a major advancement for portable computers that have made them last longer and hold more data without needing to be upgraded. The swap from NI-MH batteries to Lithium-ion ones was one of the most influential changes for portable computers, as they are all around more power dense, energy dense and release more volts than their older counterpart, while being significantly lighter, making portability an easier accessible feature for today’s devices.
Storage technology has gone through a long and in-depth history from floppy disks, holding only a megabyte or two on a physical disc of plastic coated in a metal coat that was scratched to store data. Today there are many ways to store data, from Hard drives, SSD's, SD cards, and even the cloud, being a wireless way to store data online that is always accessible through the internet and typically holds as much as you need. The cloud passed 1 Zettabyte in 2013 of held global storage (1 trillion gigabytes) and in 2025 the cloud reached over 100 Zettabytes, holding roughly half of the world’s digital information, and this is exponentially climbing as more and more people get access to the cloud and more larger forms on storage.




The History of portable computing has been a vast and important journey for computing as there has been a plethora of major advances that have paved paths for later devices. Started off with one of the first major developments is the IBM 5100, it was one of the earliest portable computers, combining a processor, keyboard, monitor, and tape drive into a single unit that was portable. Then comes the Osborne 1, which was the first commercially successful portable computer that made its name by being portable pluggable allowing business to work on the go coming with its own keyboard, screen, storage and software that was worth almost the entire price of computer itself.
The Compaq Portable was a major advancement for business making portable computers mainstream for work, being backwards compatible with IBM computers and was it was reasonably priced at 3000$ back in 1983 making it a viable purchase for businesses
The first truly successful portable laptop was the Toshiba T1100, coming with a 3.5inch floppy disk, it ran on MS-DOS software making it compatible with other popular complex computer software.

Finally Apple comes in with their Apple PowerBook 100. It revolutionised the market for laptops globally changing the layout of them, adding palm rests at the base of the laptop and adding a trackball/pad which laptops around the globe still use.

The PowerBook 100 ran on 8mb of ram and a Motorola 68000 CPU inside an extremely light 2.3 kg body which was really light for its time. It paved the path for every other laptop afterwards changing the world of portable computing till today.

and finallly the iphone which completely changed the game for portable computing, removing the need for stylis's and keyboards having a touch screen, being able to be held in the palm of your hand and holding its own OS system (iOS) that was capible of running onboard complex apps.

Societal Impact of Portable Computing
The new age of technology has been a major benefit to society and intrapersonal relationships. Having contiuous access to mobile phones and social media has allowed people to communicate with one another far more frequently than what it was in the past. Applications such as social media, along with various messaging apps creates a widespread ability to text, rather than calling people. The disadvantage of this, however, is that today's youth are far more incapable of interacting with each other, whether its talking on the phone or connecting in person. This has created a heavy reliance amongst people on AI softwares such as Replika AI in order to fill the emotional void they have from lack of human interaction. News outlets such as RTE state that nearly 1 in every 10,000 have had some sort of relationship with AI, both physical and romantic, in the last year. This lonliness epidemic is stressed by the fact that we have such easy access to phones and the internet, where the options online are limitless, making it extremely difficult to ignore. The easy access to portable computing creates an easy method of gaining and developing knowledge and skills. This access is readily available in many countries globablly, which allows individuals to form their own opinions regarding topics such as politics. On the other hand, this creates an easy way to spread misinformation and propaganda, creating hostile environments. For example, the democratic state of the United States of America since 2020 has been under extreme stress due to minsinformation being spread amongst the media, leading to an heavy mistrust in both the government and the voting system. Studies such as the Collaborative Multi-Racial Political Study highlighted that around 57% of white Americans believed in some kind of voter fraud in the 2020 elections. This highlights the strong impact misinformation has on society.

Portable Computing has completely transformed the current workplace. Access to the internet has allowed the integration of hybrid and remote work. Remote work is defined as a modern form of working from outside the workplace, often ensuring increased flexibility of a person's time. This has been proven to be important for a worker's wellbeing, giving time to hobbies and interpersonal relationships outside of the office. However, it's been recorded amongst younger generations that workers are wanting less-remote work, stating they tend to feel more loneyly during the working day. 24% of Generation Z surveyed by IRP stated that they wanted less-remote work, while 33% of Millenials opted for more remote work. This highlights a want in the more technology literate generations for more in-person human connection, despite having the option of being able to work from their own homes.

Ethical and Legal Implications
The introduction of portable computing draws safety concerns. driverless cars may begin to become more common on roads. However, as of now, these cars still have concerns based on pedestrian and other driver's safety. The security of data is also a major concern. Data leaks are unfortunately extremely common, and hackers are able to access user's personal data. Email inboxes, social media accounts and networks that computers can access are all prone to hacking. The unrestricted internet access of minors is a huge ethical concern also. Minors can access a plethora of harmful content on the internet in the form of videos and social media posts. A study by PMJ Pediatrics Open highlights a staggering amount of harmful data amongst 10-17 year olds, with 622 participants, such as cyberbullying. Illegal data is also extremely common with the increased use of portable computing. Sharing people's data without consent, pirated movies and shows and distributing them are but a few examples of the legal concerns surrounding portable computing.

Future Improvements
There are still many risks regarding portable computing. In order to improve and safeguard ourselves, there must be stricter legistlation put in place to protect both our data, and children's wellbeing. While technology continues to change and improve, we can expect more advanced forms of computing to become smaller and smaller over time, much like the improvements made to the phone over the years. AI is becoming more and more prominent in computing, so improvements need to be made in order for it to become an actual tool, rather than it being a commonly misinformed robot. Battery life for portable computing is still a major issue, so improvements also need to be made to increase battery life. AR and VR improvements will also allow these forms of technology to further merge into everyday use.

Almost all smartphones now have microprocessors which allow for increased computing power in a small place.

ARM “Advanced Risc Machines” efficiently give instructions to the circuits on the microprocessors, providing lots of computing power for relatively little energy

RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) allows for very fast data processing by reducing the number of instructions a computer can perform to the minimum

3G(third generation) mobile networks introduced in the UK from 2003 4G from 2012

Mobiles before smartphones
Mobiles before smartphones where a lot simpler. Instead of having a lot of apps to message people on there was one and instead of face time or WhatsApp video call you could only make a general phone call
-Mobiles didn't have access to the internet so people couldn't google things. Because all mobile phones weren't connected to the internet this meant that messaging and calling people wasn’t free

What is the technology behind smartphones?
There were two major factors that led to the production of the first smartphone.

The first was the development of the ARM microprocessor The ARM microprocessor was originally designed in the early 1980’s by Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson at the British company Acorn Computers. At the time ARM - stood for Acorn RISC Machines but they are now called advanced Risc Machines.

These chips are important because they can give information to the circuits very efficiently producing a lot of computing power while only taking up a small amount of energy

The addition of these chips to mobile phones allowed them to execute tasks much faster than they normally could.

The second thing that helped in the production of the first smartphones was the release of 3G Networks.

3G Networks made it possible for users to send and receive videos due to the increased data transmition rates. Today these networks have developed even further, with the arrival of 4g in 2012 and the current development of 5G

Britian held an auction in 2000 to sell the license to operate 3G networks in the UK. 6 companies paid a total of 22.5 billion which was 4 times the government’s estimate but these companies benefited greatly from having a license to operate 3G networks.

Smart phones take off:
In 2008 apple launches iphone 3G. It was open to anyone with skills to add to their own creations to an enticing range od apps, ranging from anything from mobile games to messaging apps, competitors quickly started releasing their own smartphones and by the end of 2013, 1 in 5 people owned a smartphone world wide.

Accessibility in technology means making sure that everyone can use phones, computers, and other devices, no matter their disability. It is about giving equal access and making life easier for people who might find technology difficult to use. In this section, I will talk about what accessibility means, how it has developed over time, what features exist today, and what problems still make it hard for some people to use modern technology. I will also give my own thoughts about what I believe works well and what could still be better.

Years ago, technology was not made for people with disabilities. Before smartphones be-came popular, most blind people used phones with buttons and had to remember exactly what to press for each action. Writing a message or checking the time took many steps, and most of the time, help from others was needed. I think that made people like me feel de-pendent on others instead of independent. Things started to change when companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google began to design their systems with accessibility built in. Ap-ple, for example, made accessibility one of its main values, which I believe was one of the best decisions the company ever made. It showed that accessibility should not be an extra feature—it should be part of every product.

One of the biggest breakthroughs was the creation of screen readers. A screen reader is a program that reads out what is on the screen or sends it to a braille display so that blind users can understand it. On the iPhone, this feature is called VoiceOver. On Android, it is called TalkBack, and on computers, there are programs like NVDA or Narrator. When I use VoiceOver, I can slide my finger across the screen, and the phone tells me what I am touch-ing. I can double tap to open something or swipe to move to another item. It is not an exag-geration to say that VoiceOver changed how blind people live. Before it, I had to rely on help, but now I can do everything myself, from reading messages to using maps or shopping online.

Another important improvement is braille support. Many blind users connect small devices called braille displays to their phones or computers. These devices use small moving pins that form braille letters so that you can read by touch. I often use a braille display when I want to read quietly without voice. It is great for studying or working because it gives full control and privacy. Apple supports many different types of braille displays, which makes it easier for people to find one that suits their needs.

For people with low vision, accessibility includes things like the Magnifier, which uses the camera to zoom in on objects or text, and display options such as bold text, larger fonts, and high-contrast colours. People who are deaf or hard of hearing can use features like live cap-tions or have the phone send vibrations when it detects certain sounds like alarms or crying. For people with limited movement, there is Voice Control. It lets users speak to the phone to open apps, scroll, write messages, or take photos without touching the screen. I think these tools show that accessibility is not only about helping blind users; it helps many people in different ways.

Apple also introduced something called the back tap feature. This allows users to double tap or triple tap the back of the iPhone to perform a specific action. For example, I can set a double tap to turn VoiceOver on or off, which saves me time when I need to use it quickly. The triple tap can be set to do anything I want, such as taking a screenshot, opening an app, locking the phone, or even turning on the flashlight. I think this feature is very clever be-cause it makes accessibility easier to reach for everyone. It is one of those small details that show how thoughtful design can make a big difference.

Even with all of these improvements, I still believe there are problems that need attention. Many app developers do not follow accessibility rules when designing their apps. I have opened apps where all the buttons are simply read as “button” or “image,” giving no idea of what they actually do. This makes the app impossible to use. I think that is one of the biggest frustrations for screen reader users. The tools exist, but people don’t always use them cor-rectly.

Another big issue is cost. Accessibility features themselves are free, but the devices that support them well are expensive. Not everyone can afford an iPhone or a modern braille dis-play. Some of the best braille devices cost thousands of euros, and that leaves out many peo-ple who could really benefit from them. I think accessibility should not depend on how much money you have. Everyone deserves access to the same technology.

Software updates can also cause problems. Each time a new version of iOS comes out, I feel nervous because sometimes it breaks features that used to work perfectly. There were times when VoiceOver stopped speaking or changed how gestures worked, which made it harder to use the phone. Accessibility should always be stable, and updates should be tested carefully before they are released.

Privacy is another concern. Some accessibility tools, especially voice-based features, collect information to improve accuracy. This is useful, but I think it is important to make sure that user data is safe. Accessibility should not come with the risk of losing privacy.

Lastly, I think there needs to be more awareness about accessibility. Many people still be-lieve it only matters to a small group, but in truth, it helps everyone. Large text, clear lay-outs, or voice control can make technology easier to use for older people, children, or any-one who wants simpler navigation. I believe schools and workplaces should teach more about accessibility so that it becomes a normal part of how technology is created, not some-thing added later.

To sum up, accessibility in technology is about fairness and inclusion. It allows people like me to live independently, study, and communicate freely. Tools such as screen readers, braille displays, magnifiers, voice control, and back tap features show how far technology has come. However, there are still issues like high costs, poor app design, unstable updates, and lack of awareness. I think if developers, companies, and governments worked together more seriously, accessibility could be a natural part of every device. In the end, it is not about giving special treatment to people with disabilities. It is about giving everyone the same chance to be part of the digital world.

Phones have changed how we live and communicate; they are not just tools they are a part of everyday life.

people in rural areas can now access information, banking and education using their phones
phones can also help in emergencies and can connect to family or helpline services instantly
health apps where doctors can monitor patients remotely
social life as well we can connect to people by messages, call or post anytime, anywhere
However, this creates new problems, like people becoming too dependant on their phones, there’s privacy issues, and inequality where not everyone can afford the latest technology.

The concept of “Portable private- personal territory” when someone uses a phone in a public space they create a bubble around them that travels with them. the device mediates their engagement with their psychical enviroment.

Public behaviors are shiftting examples,

people can talk, browse, send messages while in a public space but they are also more isolated and detached from their immediate psychial surroundings
" Unlike computer users, cell phone owners are mobile, immersed in the crowd, yet able to communicate beyond it"

However, this creates new problems, like people becoming too dependant on their phones, there’s privacy issues, and inequality where not everyone can afford the latest technology.

The concept of “Portable private- personal territory” when someone uses a phone in a public space they create a bubble around them that travels with them. the device mediates their engagement with their psychical enviroment.

Public behaviors are shiftting examples,

people can talk, browse, send messages while in a public space but they are also more isolated and detached from their immediate psychial surroundings
" Unlike computer users, cell phone owners are mobile, immersed in the crowd, yet able to communicate beyond it"

iphone and best accessibility features  to try

[**1 iPhone Accessibility Features That Make Life Easier for Everyone - TechPP**](https://techpp.com/2025/07/31/iphone-accessibility-features/)

 

- Accessibility in technology means making sure that everyone can use phones, computers, and other devices, no matter their disability. It is about giving equal access and making life easier for people who might find technology difficult to use. In this section, I will talk about what accessibility means, how it has developed over time, what features exist today, and what problems still make it hard for some people to use modern technology. I will also give my own thoughts about what I believe works well and what could still be better.

- Years ago, technology was not made for people with disabilities. Before smartphones be-came popular, most blind people used phones with buttons and had to remember exactly what to press for each action. Writing a message or checking the time took many steps, and most of the time, help from others was needed. I think that made people like me feel de-pendent on others instead of independent. Things started to change when companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google began to design their systems with accessibility built in. Ap-ple, for example, made accessibility one of its main values, which I believe was one of the best decisions the company ever made. It showed that accessibility should not be an extra feature—it should be part of every product.

- One of the biggest breakthroughs was the creation of screen readers. A screen reader is a program that reads out what is on the screen or sends it to a braille display so that blind users can understand it. On the iPhone, this feature is called VoiceOver. On Android, it is called TalkBack, and on computers, there are programs like NVDA or Narrator. When I use VoiceOver, I can slide my finger across the screen, and the phone tells me what I am touch-ing. I can double tap to open something or swipe to move to another item. It is not an exag-geration to say that VoiceOver changed how blind people live. Before it, I had to rely on help, but now I can do everything myself, from reading messages to using maps or shopping online.

- Another important improvement is braille support. Many blind users connect small devices called braille displays to their phones or computers. These devices use small moving pins that form braille letters so that you can read by touch. I often use a braille display when I want to read quietly without voice. It is great for studying or working because it gives full control and privacy. Apple supports many different types of braille displays, which makes it easier for people to find one that suits their needs.

- For people with low vision, accessibility includes things like the Magnifier, which uses the camera to zoom in on objects or text, and display options such as bold text, larger fonts, and high-contrast colours. People who are deaf or hard of hearing can use features like live cap-tions or have the phone send vibrations when it detects certain sounds like alarms or crying. For people with limited movement, there is Voice Control. It lets users speak to the phone to open apps, scroll, write messages, or take photos without touching the screen. I think these tools show that accessibility is not only about helping blind users; it helps many people in different ways.

- Apple also introduced something called the back tap feature. This allows users to double tap or triple tap the back of the iPhone to perform a specific action. For example, I can set a double tap to turn VoiceOver on or off, which saves me time when I need to use it quickly. The triple tap can be set to do anything I want, such as taking a screenshot, opening an app, locking the phone, or even turning on the flashlight. I think this feature is very clever be-cause it makes accessibility easier to reach for everyone. It is one of those small details that show how thoughtful design can make a big difference.

- Even with all of these improvements, I still believe there are problems that need attention. Many app developers do not follow accessibility rules when designing their apps. I have opened apps where all the buttons are simply read as “button” or “image,” giving no idea of what they actually do. This makes the app impossible to use. I think that is one of the biggest frustrations for screen reader users. The tools exist, but people don’t always use them cor-rectly.

- Another big issue is cost. Accessibility features themselves are free, but the devices that support them well are expensive. Not everyone can afford an iPhone or a modern braille dis-play. Some of the best braille devices cost thousands of euros, and that leaves out many peo-ple who could really benefit from them. I think accessibility should not depend on how much money you have. Everyone deserves access to the same technology.

- Software updates can also cause problems. Each time a new version of iOS comes out, I feel nervous because sometimes it breaks features that used to work perfectly. There were times when VoiceOver stopped speaking or changed how gestures worked, which made it harder to use the phone. Accessibility should always be stable, and updates should be tested carefully before they are released.

- Privacy is another concern. Some accessibility tools, especially voice-based features, collect information to improve accuracy. This is useful, but I think it is important to make sure that user data is safe. Accessibility should not come with the risk of losing privacy.

- Lastly, I think there needs to be more awareness about accessibility. Many people still be-lieve it only matters to a small group, but in truth, it helps everyone. Large text, clear lay-outs, or voice control can make technology easier to use for older people, children, or any-one who wants simpler navigation. I believe schools and workplaces should teach more about accessibility so that it becomes a normal part of how technology is created, not some-thing added later.

- To sum up, accessibility in technology is about fairness and inclusion. It allows people like me to live independently, study, and communicate freely. Tools such as screen readers, braille displays, magnifiers, voice control, and back tap features show how far technology has come. However, there are still issues like high costs, poor app design, unstable updates, and lack of awareness. I think if developers, companies, and governments worked together more seriously, accessibility could be a natural part of every device. In the end, it is not about giving special treatment to people with disabilities. It is about giving everyone the same chance to be part of the digital world.




Mobile and portable devices have gone through a serious evolution. Mobile phones developed from just communicators into an essential device in our day by day. Back in the 1990s mobile phones were mainly used for calls and text messages, while other devices such as personal organisers handle calendars, note taking and other daily functions. as mobile phone prices began dropping which made it more affordable over time for people, especially teenagers. This rise in accessibility and youth adoption began sharing mobile culture which made mobile phones shape into smartphones. This shows how rapidly new technologies can be created and developed to adapt into our society. Since mobile phones were hard to achieve back in the day, they were shaped into and created to be affordable and easy to carry around.

One of the main societal key points that transformed the development of the ARM microprocessor. since arm chips can provide significant computing power while using very few amounts of energy. This made smartphones able to become lightweight, portable and capable to run many different functions at once. These functions made us be able to carry a portable computer in our packet. This meant that phones could store and play music, take photos and gps services by using a touchscreen function making. Due to this, our daily behavior changed, making us rely on our phones for tasks that used to require several devices.

Another major change resulted from the move from 2g to 3g. 3G made mobile phones handle data for more complex activities such as sending and receiving a video, the use of internet and multimedia content. This turned mobile phones into an expansion on our use of information and new ways of entertainment. Later on, we got the introduction of 4g in 2012, which expanded these functions even further. These new technologies have created many opportunities for jobs, creativity and learning, making our lives easier and improving our skills and daily tasks.

Smartphones grew in popularity rapidly after the release of the iphone 3g back in 2008. By 2013, one in five people worldwide owned a smartphone, this showed how quickly these devices became part of our lives and were there to stay and develop even further as we can see nowadays. The fact that in just that few years we have adopted and developed our technologies into our lives can show our intelligence to create and adapt to change.

We can see an example of the huge impact in the live video call from the summit of mount Everest. by the use of a smartphone and a satellite link, Daniel Hughes transmitted live video to the BBC from one of the most remote places on earth. This moment demonstrated how smartphones made several changes to the way people communicate, making it possible to send complex digital data from almost anywhere. we cant still have connection and share data from some places due to the poor connection, wrong configuration or data limits.

In conclusion, the development of efficient microprocessors and fast data networks transformed mobile phones into a personal portable computing device fully connected. They have transformed how people access information, communicate and share, becoming an essential tool nowadays.

Quick facts
Almost all smartphones now have microprocessors which allow for increased computing power in a small place.

ARM “Advanced Risc Machines” efficiently give instructions to the circuits on the microprocessors, providing lots of computing power for relatively little energy

RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) allows for very fast data processing by reducing the number of instructions a computer can perform to the minimum

3G(third generation) mobile networks introduced in the UK from 2003 4G from 2012

Mobiles before smartphones
Mobiles before smartphones where a lot simpler. Instead of having a lot of apps to message people on there was one and instead of face time or WhatsApp video call you could only make a general phone call
-Mobiles didn't have access to the internet so people couldn't google things. Because all mobile phones weren't connected to the internet this meant that messaging and calling people wasn’t free

What is the technology behind smartphones?
There were two major factors that led to the production of the first smartphone.

The first was the development of the ARM microprocessor The ARM microprocessor was originally designed in the early 1980’s by Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson at the British company Acorn Computers. At the time ARM - stood for Acorn RISC Machines but they are now called advanced Risc Machines.

These chips are important because they can give information to the circuits very efficiently producing a lot of computing power while only taking up a small amount of energy

The addition of these chips to mobile phones allowed them to execute tasks much faster than they normally could.

The second thing that helped in the production of the first smartphones was the release of 3G Networks.

3G Networks made it possible for users to send and receive videos due to the increased data transmition rates. Today these networks have developed even further, with the arrival of 4g in 2012 and the current development of 5G

Britian held an auction in 2000 to sell the license to operate 3G networks in the UK. 6 companies paid a total of 22.5 billion which was 4 times the government’s estimate but these companies benefited greatly from having a license to operate 3G networks.

Smart phones take off:
In 2008 apple launches iphone 3G. It was open to anyone with skills to add to their own creations to an enticing range od apps, ranging from anything from mobile games to messaging apps, competitors quickly started releasing their own smartphones and by the end of 2013, 1 in 5 people owned a smartphone world wide.
