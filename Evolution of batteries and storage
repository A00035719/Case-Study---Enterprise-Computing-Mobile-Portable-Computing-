The evolution of batteries for phones and storage has been a major advancement for portable computers that have made them last longer and hold more data without needing to be upgraded. The swap from NI-MH batteries to Lithium-ion ones was one of the most influential changes for portable computers, as they are all around more power dense, energy dense and release more volts than their older counterpart, while being significantly lighter, making portability an easier accessible feature for today’s devices.
Storage technology has gone through a long and in-depth history from floppy disks, holding only a megabyte or two on a physical disc of plastic coated in a metal coat that was scratched to store data. Today there are many ways to store data, from Hard drives, SSD's, SD cards, and even the cloud, being a wireless way to store data online that is always accessible through the internet and typically holds as much as you need. The cloud passed 1 Zettabyte in 2013 of held global storage (1 trillion gigabytes) and in 2025 the cloud reached over 100 Zettabytes, holding roughly half of the world’s digital information, and this is exponentially climbing as more and more people get access to the cloud and more larger forms on storage.
