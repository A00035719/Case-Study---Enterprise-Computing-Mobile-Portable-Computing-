# Case Study Semester 1 Nature of Enterprise Computing Group 29
## Introduction

The rise of portable computing represents one of the most gradual and rapidly developments in technology. Devices have evolved from simple mobile phones into powerful smartphones capable of communication, entertainment and education purposes. From an engineering perspective, the evolution of smartphones has been innovating from developing ARM microprocessors, energy-efficient RISC architectures and advanced mobile network technologies like 3G, 4G and 5G. These have enabled improved performance in computing in compact devices.

From a societal viewpoint, portable computing has changed communication, information accessibility and social interactions. Smartphones have facilitated a constant connection between users, remote work and online education. However, these benefits come along with challenges such as increased social isolation, dependence on devices, privacy concerns and misinformation.

This case study traces the historical evolution of portable computing, exploring technical innovation and social concerns. This study provides an understanding of how technical choices influence social decisions and ethical behavior.

## Hisorical Development
Exactly what to press for each action. Writing a message or checking the time took many steps, and most of the time, help from others was needed. I think that made people like me feel de-pendent on others instead of independent. Things started to change when companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google began to design their systems with accessibility built in. Ap-ple, for example, made accessibility one of its main values. It showed that accessibility should not be an extra feature—it should be part of every product.

## Engineering Perspective
 Years ago, technology was not made for people with disabilities. Before smartphones be-came popular, most blind people used phones with buttons and had to remember e
Mobile and portable devices have gone through a serious evolution. Mobile phones developed from just communicators into an essential device in our day by day. Back in the 1990s mobile phones were mainly used for calls and text messages, while other devices such as personal organisers handled calendars, note taking and other daily functions. As mobile phone prices began dropping, they became more affordable over time for people, especially teenagers. This rise in accessibility and youth adoption began shaping mobile culture which made mobile phones develop into smartphones.

One of the main engineering developments was the ARM microprocessor. ARM chips can provide significant computing power while using very few amounts of energy. This made smartphones lightweight, portable and capable of running many different functions at once. These functions made us able to carry a portable computer in our pocket. Phones could store and play music, take photos and provide GPS services using touchscreen functions.

The evolution of batteries for phones and storage have been a major advancment for portable computers that have made them last longer and hold more data without needing to be upgraded. The swap from NI-MH batteries to Lithium-ion ones was one of the most influencal changed for portable computers, as they are all around more power dense, energy dense and release more volts than their older counterpart, while being significantly lighter, making portability an easier accesible feature for todays devices.

Storage technology has gone through a long and indepth histroy from floppy disks, holding a only a megabite or two on a physical disc of plastic coated in a metal coat that was scratched to store data. Today there are many ways to store data, from Harddrives, SSD's, SD cards, and even the cloud, being a wireless way to store data online that is always accessible through the internet and typically holds as much as you need. The cloud passed 1 Zettabyte in 2013 of held global storage (1 Trillion gigabytes) and in 2025 the cloud has reached over 100 Zettabytes, holding roughly half of the worlds digital information, and this is exponentionally climbing as more and more people get access to the cloud and more larger forms on storage.

Another major engineering change resulted from the move from 2G to 3G. 3G made mobile phones handle data for more complex activities such as sending and receiving video, internet use, and multimedia content. The introduction of 4G in 2012 expanded these functions even further.

Smartphones also grew in popularity rapidly after the release of the iPhone 3G in 2008\. By 2013, one in five people worldwide owned a smartphone, showing how quickly these devices became part of our lives. This fast adoption shows our intelligence to create and adapt to change.

A significant example of engineering capability was the live video call from the summit of Mount Everest. Using a smartphone and a satellite link, Daniel Hughes transmitted live video to the BBC from one of the most remote places on Earth. This showed how smartphones changed communication by enabling complex digital data transmission from nearly anywhere, even if some places still have poor connection or data limits.

Engineering also plays an important role in accessibility. Companies like Apple have created screen readers, braille support, magnifiers, voice control and back tap features that allow people with disabilities to use smartphones independently. Screen readers like VoiceOver allow blind users to navigate the screen with gestures. Braille displays can connect to phones to read text using moving pins. Features such as larger text, live captions, and sound detection alerts support people with different needs. These tools show how engineering can address societal needs and promote inclusivity.

One of the biggest breakthroughs was the creation of screen readers. A screen reader is a program that reads out what is on the screen or sends it to a braille display so that blind users can understand it. On the iPhone, this feature is called VoiceOver. On Android, it is called TalkBack, and on computers, there are programs like NVDA or Narrator. When I use VoiceOver, I can slide my finger across the screen, and the phone tells me what I am touch-ing. I can double tap to open something or swipe to move to another item. It is not an exag-geration to say that VoiceOver changed how blind people live. Before it, I had to rely on help, but now I can do everything myself, from reading messages to using maps or shopping online.

Another important improvement is braille support. Many blind users connect small devices called braille displays to their phones or computers. These devices use small moving pins that form braille letters so that you can read by touch. I often use a braille display when I want to read quietly without voice. It is great for studying or working because it gives full control and privacy. Apple supports many different types of braille displays, which makes it easier for people to find one that suits their needs.

For people with low vision, accessibility includes things like the Magnifier, which uses the camera to zoom in on objects or text, and display options such as bold text, larger fonts, and high-contrast colours. People who are deaf or hard of hearing can use features like live cap-tions or have the phone send vibrations when it detects certain sounds like alarms or crying. For people with limited movement, there is Voice Control. It lets users speak to the phone to open apps, scroll, write messages, or take photos without touching the screen. I think these tools show that accessibility is not only about helping blind users; it helps many people in different ways.

Apple also introduced something called the back tap feature. This allows users to double tap or triple tap the back of the iPhone to perform a specific action. For example, I can set a double tap to turn VoiceOver on or off, which saves me time when I need to use it quickly. The triple tap can be set to do anything I want, such as taking a screenshot, opening an app, locking the phone, or even turning on the flashlight. It makes accessibility easier to reach for everyone and it is one of those small details that show how thoughtful design can make a big difference.


## Societal Perspective
Having continuous access to mobile phones and social media has allowed people to communicate with one another far more frequently than in the past. Applications such as social media and messaging apps created a widespread ability to text rather than call. The disadvantage of this, however, is that today's youth are far more incapable of interacting with each other, whether it’s talking on the phone or connecting in person.

This has created a heavy reliance on AI software such as Replika AI in order to fill the emotional void that comes from lack of human interaction. RTE states that nearly 1 in every 10,000 people have had some sort of relationship with AI, both physical and romantic, in the last year. The loneliness epidemic is stressed by the fact that we have such easy access to phones and the internet, where the options online are limitless.

Portable computing also creates an easy method of gaining and developing knowledge and skills. This access is available in many countries, allowing individuals to form their own opinions regarding topics such as politics. On the other hand, this also creates an easy way to spread misinformation and propaganda, creating hostile environments. For example, the United States since 2020 has experienced extreme stress due to misinformation spreading across the media, leading to mistrust in government and voting systems. Studies such as the Collaborative Multi-Racial Political Study showed that around 57% of white Americans believed in some kind of voter fraud in the 2020 elections, highlighting the strong impact misinformation has on society.

Portable Computing has also transformed the current workplace. Access to the internet allows hybrid and remote work, giving people flexibility and supporting wellbeing. However, younger generations sometimes want less-remote work because they feel lonely working alone at home. For example, 24% of Generation Z surveyed by IRP wanted less-remote work, while 33% of Millennials preferred more remote work.

Phones have changed how we live and communicate; they are not just tools, they are part of everyday life. People in rural areas can access information, banking and education using their phones. Phones help in emergencies and connect people instantly to family or helpline services. Health apps allow doctors to monitor patients remotely. Socially, we can connect to people anytime, anywhere.

However, this creates problems such as dependence on phones, privacy issues and inequality where not everyone can afford the latest technology.

The concept of “portable private-personal territory” explains how using a phone in a public space creates a private bubble that travels with the user. This changes public behavior. People can talk, browse or message while in a public space but are more isolated from their immediate surroundings. As one description states:  
"Unlike computer users, cell phone owners are mobile, immersed in the crowd, yet able to communicate beyond it."


## Ethical and Legal Considerations
The introduction of portable computing brings physcial safety concerns. Driverless cars may become more common, but concerns remain about pedestrian and driver safety. Data security is also a major concern. Data leaks are extremely common, and hackers can access personal data through email inboxes, social media and networks. This is important because data privacy should be crucial while using the internet, as it decreases data fishing.

Unrestricted internet access by minors is also an ethical concern. Children can access harmful content in videos and social media. A study by PMJ Pediatrics Open found harmful data and cyberbullying among 10–17 year olds, with 622 participants. Minors should not be exposed to this type of content as they don't fully understand what it is and why it is harmful to them. This is far too common amongst youth today and it's important that minors should be protected from such, as it harms their mental wellbeing. 

Portable Computing has blurred the lines between private and public information. Social media and the internet use amongst young people is extremely common, however a lot of information they share is more public than they realise. This increases risks of identity theft and data fishing from companies, along with illegally selling data shared on these applications. Illegally shared data allows companies to beat out competitors and tailor their product or service to target you more specifically, allowing them to make more money from you. Once that data is on the internet, whether intended to be private or not, it is still public for companies to view. This creates a major ethical conflict between commercial incentives and user autonomy. Engineers have a moral obligation to protect the user and their data protection. Some accessibility tools, especially voice-based features, collect information to improve accuracy. This is useful, but it is important to make sure that user data is safe. Accessibility should not come with the risk of losing privacy.

It has also been recorded that constant access to computing at our fingertips, is decreasing our situational awareness and attention spans. The exposure of young children to short form content online such as Tiktok or Instagram Reels has been proven to highlight much lower limits of patience and focus. According to Doctor Gloria Mark in an article from the American Psychology Association says this is due to constantly switching tasks and stimuli. This is important as the technological world continues to develop, as people may become less functional members of society. Web developers should have an ethical duty to the users to decrease risks of erosion of cognitive functions. This may be helpful towards the gorwing popularity of short form content causing certain cognitive skills such as deep thinking and focus from eroding.

There are still many risks regarding portable computing. To improve safety, stricter legislation is needed to protect data and children’s wellbeing. Technology will continue to change, and more advanced computing will likely become smaller over time. AI is becoming more common, and improvements are needed to make it a reliable tool rather than a source of misinformation. Battery life remains a problem, so improvements are needed to extend battery performance. AR and VR will also merge more into everyday use as the technological aspects of them become more advanced.

Despite improvements to accessibility, engineering challenges remain. Some apps do not follow accessibility guidelines, making them difficult or impossible for screen reader users. Devices that support accessibility well can be expensive. Software updates can break features that previously worked. Privacy concerns also arise when voice-based tools collect user data. Accessibility requires continuous attention, proper testing and awareness. Many app developers do not follow accessibility rules when designing their apps. There are apps where all the buttons are simply read as “button” or “image,” giving no idea of what they actually do. This makes the app impossible to use and is one of the biggest frustrations for screen reader users. The tools exist, but people don’t always use them cor-rectly.

Another big issue is cost. Accessibility features themselves are free, but the devices that support them well are expensive. Not everyone can afford an iPhone or a modern braille dis-play. Some of the best braille devices cost thousands of euros, and that leaves out many peo-ple who could really benefit from them. I think accessibility should not depend on how much money you have. Everyone deserves access to the same technology.

Software updates can also cause problems. Each time a new version of iOS comes out, there are issues because sometimes it breaks features that used to work perfectly. There were times when VoiceOver stopped speaking or changed how gestures worked, which made it harder to use the phone. Accessibility should always be stable, and updates should be tested carefully before they are released.

Lastly, there needs to be more awareness about accessibility. Many people still believe it only matters to a small group, but in truth, it helps everyone. Large text, clear lay-outs, or voice control can make technology easier to use for older people, children, or any-one who wants simpler navigation. Schools and workplaces should teach more about accessibility so that it becomes a normal part of how technology is created, not some-thing added later.

To sum up, accessibility in technology is about fairness and inclusion. It allows people to live independently, study, and communicate freely. Tools such as screen readers, braille displays, magnifiers, voice control, and back tap features show how far technology has come. However, there are still issues like high costs, poor app design, unstable updates, and lack of awareness. I think if developers, companies, and governments worked together more seriously, accessibility could be a natural part of every device. In the end, it is not about giving special treatment to people with disabilities. It is about giving everyone the same chance to be part of the digital world.


## Systems Perspective
Portable computing systems include hardware, software, networks and user interfaces. ARM processors reduce energy consumption, enabling smaller devices. RISC architecture reduces the number of instructions for faster processing. 3G, 4G and 5G networks allow higher data speeds.

Touchscreens integrate multiple functions into one interface. Accessibility systems like VoiceOver, TalkBack, braille displays, magnifiers, voice control and haptic feedback support users with disabilities. iPhones include back tap features to activate accessibility shortcuts quickly.

Network systems support hybrid work environments. With portable computing systems, information can be accessed anywhere. However, system vulnerabilities like software bugs, accessibility failures, data leaks and misinformation spread through network systems create societal risks.

Portable computing relies greatly on energy management systems. People carry their phones, laptops, and tablets around all day so they can receive calls, texts, and emails. some people spend all day working on their devices too and dont always have access to a plug socket to charge their devices. systems nowadays use methods like smart battery monitoring and low power comunication protocols. these systems help the battery last longer while making sure the performance of the devices isnt effected.

Since its invention battery technology has taken many steps to improve battery life batteries started as nickel then to lithium ion and finally to solid state batteries. each time the batteries where upgraded people could use their devices for longer and their devices would gradually start to perform better with the upgrades. longer battery life along with devices performing better meant people where slowly becoming more able to work out of the office where ever they went.


## Conclusion
Overall, it can be determined that the evolution of portable computing shows how engineering has innovated through the years and how social behavior has been influenced by devices. Engineering advances in microprocessors, mobile networks and device design shaped how we access information, perform tasks and interact. This shows how important engineering is in shaping life.

From a societal point of view, portable computing has improved communication, education and social connection. But it has also produced challenges such as overuse of devices, reliance on technology and misinformation. Accessibility features like screen readers and voice control show how engineering can support societal needs.

Portable computing shows that technological progress must be accompanied by ethical reflection and societal consideration. By prioritizing accessibility and privacy, engineers and communities can ensure portable computing continues to develop while minimizing risks. The future of portable computing is not only based on technical advances but also on responsible digital society.
