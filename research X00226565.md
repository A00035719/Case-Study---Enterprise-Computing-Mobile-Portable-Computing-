## Research from link  

### Quick facts 

- Almost all smartphones now have microprocessors which allow for increased computing power in a small place. 

- ARM “Advanced Risc Machines” efficiently give instructions to the circuits on the microprocessors, providing lots of computing power for relatively little energy 

- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) allows for very fast data processing by reducing the number of instructions a computer can perform to the minimum 

- 3G(third generation) mobile networks introduced in the UK from 2003 4G from 2012 

## Mobiles before smartphones 

 - Mobiles before smartphones where a lot simpler. Instead of having a lot of apps to message people on there was one and instead of face time or WhatsApp video call you could only make a general phone call 

 

-Mobiles didn't have access to the internet so people couldn't google things. Because all mobile phones weren't connected to the internet this meant that messaging and calling people wasn’t free 

 

## What is the technology behind smartphones? 

- There were two major factors that led to the production of the first smartphone.  


- The first was the development of the ARM microprocessor The ARM microprocessor was originally designed in the early 1980’s by Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson at the British company Acorn Computers. At the time ARM - stood for Acorn RISC Machines but they are now called advanced Risc Machines. 

- These chips are important because they can give information to the circuits very efficiently producing a lot of computing power while only taking up a small amount of energy 

- The addition of these chips to mobile phones allowed them to execute tasks much faster than they normally could. 

- The second thing that helped in the production of the first smartphones was the release of 3G Networks. 

- 3G Networks made it possible for users to send and receive videos due to the increased data transmition rates.  Today these networks have developed even further, with the arrival of 4g in 2012 and the current development of 5G 

- Britian held an auction in 2000 to sell the license to operate 3G networks in the UK. 6 companies paid a total of 22.5 billion which was 4 times the government’s estimate but these companies benefited greatly from having a license to operate 3G networks. 

 

## Smart phones take off: 

- In 2008 apple launches iphone 3G. It was open to anyone with skills to add to their own creations to an enticing range od apps, ranging from anything from mobile games to messaging apps, competitors quickly started releasing their own smartphones and by the end of 2013, 1 in 5 people owned a smartphone world wide.
