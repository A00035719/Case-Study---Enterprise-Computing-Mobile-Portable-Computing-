## Societal Impact of Portable Computing


The new age of technology has been a major benefit to society and intrapersonal relationships. 
Having contiuous access to mobile phones and social media has allowed people to communicate with one another far more frequently than what it was in the past.
Applications such as social media, along with various messaging apps creates a widespread ability to text, rather than calling people. The disadvantage of this, however, is that today's youth are far more incapable of interacting with each other, whether its talking on the phone or connecting in person.
This has created a heavy reliance amongst people on AI softwares such as Replika AI in order to fill the emotional void they have from lack of human interaction. 
News outlets such as RTE state that nearly 1 in every 10,000 have had some sort of relationship with AI, both physical and romantic, in the last year. 
This lonliness epidemic is stressed by the fact that we have such easy access to phones and the internet, where the options online are limitless, making it extremely difficult to ignore. 
The easy access to portable computing creates an easy method of gaining and developing knowledge and skills. 
This access is readily available in many countries globablly, which allows individuals to form their own opinions regarding topics such as politics. On the other hand, this creates an easy way to spread misinformation and propaganda, creating hostile environments. 
For example, the democratic state of the United States of America since 2020 has been under extreme stress due to minsinformation being spread amongst the media, leading to an heavy mistrust in both the government and the voting system. 
Studies such as the Collaborative Multi-Racial Political Study highlighted that around 57% of white Americans believed in some kind of voter fraud in the 2020 elections. 
This highlights the strong impact misinformation has on society.
