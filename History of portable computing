The History of portable computing has been a vast and important journey for computing as there has been a plethora of major advances that have paved paths for later devices. Started off with one of the first major developments is the IBM 5100, it was one of the earliest portable computers, combining a processor, keyboard, monitor, and tape drive into a single unit that was portable. Then comes the Osborne 1, which was the first commercially successful portable computer that made its name by being portable pluggable allowing business to work on the go coming with its own keyboard, screen, storage and software that was worth almost the entire price of computer itself.
The Compaq Portable was a major advancement for business making portable computers mainstream for work, being backwards compatible with IBM computers and was it was reasonably priced at 3000$ back in 1983 making it a viable purchase for businesses
The first truly successful portable laptop was the Toshiba T1100, coming with a 3.5inch floppy disk, it ran on MS-DOS software making it compatible with other popular complex computer software.

Finally Apple comes in with their Apple PowerBook 100. It revolutionised the market for laptops globally changing the layout of them, adding palm rests at the base of the laptop and adding a trackball/pad which laptops around the globe still use.

The PowerBook 100 ran on 8mb of ram and a Motorola 68000 CPU inside an extremely light 2.3 kg body which was really light for its time. It paved the path for every other laptop afterwards changing the world of portable computing till today.

and finallly the iphone which completely changed the game for portable computing, removing the need for stylis's and keyboards having a touch screen, being able to be held in the palm of your hand and holding its own OS system (iOS) that was capible of running onboard complex apps.
